### Introduction

The ASP.NET Boilerplate framework is designed to be independent of any
database schema and to be as generic as possible. Therefore, it leaves
some concepts **abstract** and **optional**, like audit logging, session
management and authorization, which require some sort of **data store**.

**Module Zero** implements all the fundamental concepts of the ASP.NET
Boilerplate framework such as [tenant
management](/Pages/Documents/Zero/Tenant-Management)
(**multi-tenancy**), [role
management](/Pages/Documents/Zero/Role-Management), [user
management](/Pages/Documents/Zero/User-Management),
[session](/Pages/Documents/Abp-Session),
[authorization](/Pages/Documents/Authorization) ([permission
management](/Pages/Documents/Zero/Permission-Management)), [setting
management](/Pages/Documents/Setting-Management), [language
management](/Pages/Documents/Zero/Language-Management), [audit
logging](/Pages/Documents/Audit-Logging) and more.

Module Zero defines entities and implements the **domain logic** (domain
layer). It leaves the application and presentation layers to the
application. You can use the [startup
template](/Pages/Documents/Zero/Startup-Template) to create your own
application based on Module Zero.

### Microsoft ASP.NET Identity

This module has 2 versions:

-   The Abp.Zero.\* packages are built on Microsoft ASP.NET Identity and
    Entity Framework 6.x.
-   The Abp.ZeroCore.\* packages are built on Microsoft ASP.NET Core
    Identity and Entity Framework Core. These packages support .net
    core too.

### Source code

The Module Zero source code is separate from ASP.NET Boilerplate and hosted
on <https://github.com/aspnetboilerplate/module-zero>. It's distributed
via [NuGet](/Pages/Documents/Zero/Nuget-Packages).
